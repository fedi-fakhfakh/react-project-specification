The project focuses on creating a blogging platform where users can create an account, log in, and share their thoughts through blog posts. The application allows users to sign up by providing their personal information such as first name, last name, email, and password. Upon successful registration, a unique user ID is assigned to each user, and their account details are stored in a JSON file. Users can then log in using their credentials to access their account. Once logged in, users can create new blog posts by entering a title and content. The blog posts are associated with the user's ID and added to their profile. The application utilizes React, Redux, and React Router for managing state, handling navigation, and rendering components. The data is retrieved and updated using Axios, allowing users to interact with the JSON file to create and retrieve blog posts. The platform also features a homepage where users can browse and view blog posts created by other users. Overall, the project aims to provide a user-friendly and engaging environment for individuals to express their thoughts and engage in meaningful discussions through blog posts.
